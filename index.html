  <h1>Privacy Policy for FullStep – Walk & Run</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 16, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> Collected when you start GPS-based walking or running activities to track distance, pace, and route. If you enable background tracking, location may continue to be collected when the screen is off to ensure accurate activity tracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Activity Data:</strong> Steps, distance, pace, calories, duration, and walk/run history.</li>
    <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> Maps and images of your walks or runs that you may choose to save or share.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Inputs:</strong> Weight, height, water intake, and heart rate, if you choose to enter them.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To track and display your walking and running activities.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing</h2>

  </ul>

    <li>Uninstalling the app permanently removes all locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. User Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can enable or disable location and background location permissions at any time through your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can control background tracking within the app.</li>
    <li>Background location is used only during active walking or running sessions to ensure accurate tracking and is not used for advertising or analytics.</li>
    <li>If you require assistance or have data-related concerns, you may contact us using the email below.</li>
